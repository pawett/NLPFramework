BAGHDAD , Iraq ( AP ) _ An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team resumed work in Iraq Friday , nearly two months after his team was effectively blocked .
Scott Ritter led his team on a 10-hour tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as ` ` sensitive ' ' by the Iraqi authorities , U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said .
` ` All sites were inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities , ' ' Dacey said .
At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard , a well-placed source told The Associated Press .
Previously the Iraqis have resisted attempts to inspect such quarters .
The U.N. Security Council has charged the inspectors with verifying that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction .
It was the first time that Ritter , who arrived Thursday with some 50 inspectors for a tour likely to last over a week , had been allowed to carry out an inspection since Jan. 13 .
Then the Baghdad government stopped providing Ritter 's team with escorts , making it impossible for him to enter any site .
Iraq alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons .
The official Iraqi News Agency , which gives the daily tally of inspections , did not mention Ritter by name , but said Friday that team no .
225 _ which Ritter heads _ made surprise visits to a number of sites and was assisted by aerial surveillance .
Five other U.N. inspection teams visited a total of nine other sites , the agency reported .
An Iraqi official , speaking on customary condition of anonymity , said Ritter would not try to visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors .
The official said these sites could only be visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid down by the Feb. 23 accord signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz .
Ritter 's return is seen as something of a test of that agreement , under which Iraq agreed to give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein 's presidential palaces .
The United States had moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said it would strike Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites , including Saddam 's palaces .
Iraq had argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty .
A Pentagon spokesman said Thursday that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain until Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections .
` ` We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable future , ' ' said spokesman Kenneth Bacon .
The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who appointed a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday as his special representative to Iraq .
Prakash Shah , 58 , a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations , is part of an effort by Annan to expand contacts with the Iraqi leadership .
Palace inspections are not expected to start until the new agreement 's procedures are in place .
U.N. officials in New York on Friday finished drafting the rules , in consultation with Iraqi diplomats .
The procedures are due to go before the Security Council next week .
The Security Council has said it will not lift the sweeping sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says considerable gaps remain between Israeli and Palestinian positions before next week 's talks in London .
He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meet separately Monday with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
At a news conference with US Vice President Al Gore in Jerusalem , Mr. Netanyahu suggested Israel might be willing to move a little on issues holding up peace , but he said he expects an equal effort from the Palestinians .
If Israel is asked to uh stretch itself on matters that are vital to its security concerns , then we must see an equal effort on the other side .
Mr. Gore called on Israel to continue taking risks for peace .
Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease his isolation , though , the international pressure against him clicked up another notch .
The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait 's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq , allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods .
Secretary of State James Baker , speaking on ABC News ' " This Week , " said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries " a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing . "
The U.S. maintains that under the U.N. charter , the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the collective enforcement of international sanctions .
Mr. Baker declined to use the word blockade , but said that " interdiction " of Iraqi shipments would begin " almost instantly . "
In a statement , the White House said it would do " whatever is necessary " to ensure compliance with the sanctions .
Other Bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American , British , French , Canadian , Soviet , German and Australian ships -- may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in .
President Bush implied as much yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would apply to food .
The president responded , " Everything , everything . "
While shying away from actually using the word " blockade , " Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq .
" No point getting into all these semantics , " he said .
" The main thing is to stop the oil from coming out of there . "
The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation .
Though they insist they are n 't trying to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack , officials hope that if he strikes again , the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation .
Iraq 's first option , of course , may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil .
Speaking on the ABC program , Abdul Amir al-Anbari , Iraq 's ambassador to the U.N. , asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a " depression " and the rest of the world into an economic " crisis . "
Iraq clearly is trying to woo back more Arab support in case the conflict drags on , hoping that its neighbors eventually will help it survive a prolonged war of economic attrition with the West .
So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom .
Then yesterday , he tried to entice Arab leaders with his proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of Kuwait with Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .
The proposal also called for replacing American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces .
The Bush administration immediately said it " categorically " rejects the proposals .
And President Bush yesterday , asked whether he was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations , replied : " I do n 't see anything to be pleasing in there at all . "
American strategists are calculating , though , that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat .
At that point , rather than go through the humiliation of backing out of Kuwait , the Iraqis might well conclude that they need to lash out in some way to shake things up .
In that event , Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices .
The first would be to launch the much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia , hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve his bargaining position .
But that option is growing less and less likely as thousands of American , British , Egyptian , Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom .
The Saudis even have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters , virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force , which managed to escape the Iraqi invasion , Saudi officials said .
The Saudi " window of vulnerability .
.
.
is closing very fast , " Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the Saudi ambassador to Washington , said over the weekend .
The second possibility would be to start a fight with Israel , in hopes that all Arabs would have to move behind Iraq in a fight against their common Israeli enemy .
In such an event , Saddam Hussein also might calculate , the Saudis would be under pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of America 's close ties with Israel .
Iraq could start hostilities with Israel either through a direct attack or by attacking Jordan .
Israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because it wo n 't allow Iraq 's dangerous army to take control of Jordan 's long border with Israel .
Iraq 's third attack option would be to start an undeclared war on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism .
Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets , Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas , have ties to Baghdad .
And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S.
And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait .
They are n 't being allowed to leave and could become hostages .
If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition , the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general , and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein .
But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam Hussein as a man who , despite some recklessness , will back down if he must .
" This is a guy who is impulsive , and therefore capable of big miscalculations , " says one senior administration official involved in managing the crisis .
The official adds , though , that " at the same time , we think he is someone who is capable of rational judgments when it comes to power .
And when he finds something is unprofitable , then one can see certain accommodations . "
Thus , administration aides will be trying to calculate whether Saddam Hussein 's proposed diplomatic formula for getting out of Kuwait represents the first sign he is searching for a way out or simply is a public relations stunt .
There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he 's up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough .
The biggest worry is that if he decides he needs a way out of his predicament but does n 't see a face-saving method , he could lash out in dangerous and unpredictable ways .
U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous .
In the first days after President Bush announced the dispatching of U.S. troops , they note , the Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -- having them read by a television announcer .
" That shows he 's nervous about pinpointing his location , either because he 's afraid we 'll find him , or that internal enemies will , " says one U.S. official .
The unpredictability of Iraq 's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia .
Pentagon officials say the goal is to put 40,000 troops in the region by the end of the month .
But the administration is n 't putting any upper limit on how high the force could go after that , calculating that it would be a mistake to underestimate and an advantage to keep Saddam Hussein guessing .
U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past that they were capable of deploying as many as 300,000 troops .
And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary .
Over the weekend , Pentagon officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F. Kennedy -- and its powerful group of support ships could head for the Middle East within a few days .
Three other carriers and their escort vessels already are stationed within striking distance of Iraq or are steaming toward the area .
But unless the military situation changes drastically , military officials say , the most likely plan will be for the Kennedy to eventually replace the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower , which has been on patrol since March and was scheduled to return to port before hostilities erupted in Kuwait .

The Pentagon said today it will re-examine the question are the remains inside the Tomb of the Unknown from the Vietnam War , in fact , known ?
CBS News first reported last night that the tomb may contain the remains of Air Force pilot Michael Blassie .
There was a suspicion the body was Blassie because his uniform and ID card were found near the body in Vietnam .
But subsequently , they were lost .
Blassie 's mother now wants the remains in the tomb tested for DNA .
Integra-A Hotel amp Restaurant Co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week .
Under the offer , shareholders will receive one right for each 105 common shares owned .
Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $100 face amount of 13.5% bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share .
The rights , which expire Nov. 21 , can be exercised for $100 each .
Integra , which owns and operates hotels , said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that are n 't exercised by other shareholders .
Hallwood , a Cleveland merchant bank , owns about 11% of Integra .
Dataproducts Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to block a tender offer by DPC Acquisition Partners , alleging that the hostile offer violates a standstill agreement between the two concerns .
DPC , an investor group led by New York-based Crescott Investment Associates , had itself filed a suit in state court in Los Angeles seeking to nullify the agreement .
Earlier this year , Dataproducts had rejected a $15 a share offer from DPC , saying it was n 't adequately financed .
DPC last week launched a new , $10-a-share offer for the Woodland Hills , Calif.-based computer printer maker .
DPC said it could n 't comment on the suit .
Ratners Group PLC 's U.S. subsidiary has agreed to acquire jewelry retailer Weisfield 's Inc. for $50 a share , or about $55 million .
Weisfield 's shares soared on the announcement yesterday , closing up $11 to close at $50 in national over-the-counter trading .
Ratners and Weisfield 's said they reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of Weisfield 's by Sterling Inc. The companies said the acquisition is subject to a definitive agreement .
They said they expect the transaction to be completed by Dec. 15 .
Weisfield 's , based in Seattle , Wash. , currently operates 87 specialty jewelry stores in nine states .
In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 , the company reported sales of $59.5 million and pretax profit of $2.9 million .
Ratners , which controls 25% of the British jewelry market , would increase the number of its U.S. stores to about 450 stores from 360 .
It has said it hopes to control 5% of jewelry business in the U.S. by 1992 ; currently it controls about 2% .
Crossland Savings Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $5.25 , down $1.875 , a 26% decline .
A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $380 million of preferred stock does n 't meet the " core capital " criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance .
Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .
It would n 't identify the bankers .
Additionally , Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $175.5 million , or $13.44 a share , compared with net income of $27.1 million , or $1.16 a share , a year ago .
A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $143.6 million of goodwill .
The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and , consequently , to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions .
Crossland recorded an additional $20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter .
Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $35.6 million from $70.1 million a year ago .
However , non-interest income rose to $23.5 million from $22 million .
Third-quarter loan originations dropped sharply to $663 million from $1 billion a year ago .
Standard amp Poor 's Corp. lowered the rating on Crossland 's preferred stock to double-C from single-B-minus and placed it on CreditWatch for possible further downgrade .
It also placed on CreditWatch for possible downgrade other securities , including the double-B-minus/B rating of Crossland 's certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes .
About $518 million of debt is affected .
London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down .
London shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in New York and by the drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson 's resignation .
It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling , but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading , and signs of further weakness in the British pound , proved a hefty load to bear .
New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed .
The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1 , down 4.5% from the previous Friday and 6.8% from Oct. 13 , when Wall Street 's plunge helped spark the current weakness in London .
The 30-share index settled 42.0 points lower at 1678.5 .
Volume was 840.8 million shares , up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week 's most active session .
Dealers said the turnover , largely confined to the 100-share index stocks , partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account .
But they said Friday 's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain 's currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's cabinet .
A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas , the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded , was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson 's departure and Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet shuffle .
He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain 's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization .
British Gas shed 8.5 pence a share to close at 185 pence ( $2.90 ) .
Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson 's successor , John Major , had only been in the job one day .
Besides British Gas , British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares .
British Petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded .
Dealers said the multinational oil company was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into Shell Trading amp Transport .
Shell eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares .
Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues , Imperial Chemical Industries dropped 11 to #10.86 , Hanson skidded 9.5 to 200.5 , and British Telecom fell 10 to 250 .
In Tokyo , stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading .
The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29 .
In early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44 .
On Friday , the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76 .
First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion shares , up from 886 million shares Thursday .
An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday .
Dealers placed heavy buy orders in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions .
But they failed to sell these stocks to client investors , who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made this week , the Wako official said .
Fund managers said Friday 's profittaking was a natural result of the week 's " abnormal fever " in buying real estate , shipbuilding , steel and construction shares .
Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday , the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4% .
The DAX dropped 19.69 points Friday to 1462.93 .
Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation , were responsible .
Traders said that selling pressure wasn 't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest .
They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend .
" It 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us , " said Valentin Von Korff , a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt .
" If you take away the outside influences , the market itself looks very cheap .
What 's happening here is n 't justified by the fundamentals . "
Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week .
That 's leaving small investors with cold feet , they said , and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well , at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat .
Elsewhere , share prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Amsterdam , Brussels and Stockholm , and were mixed in Milan .
The British shakeup was widely cited for the declines .
Share prices also closed lower in Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Manila , Wellington and Seoul .
Concern about declines in other markets , especially New York , caused selling pressure .
