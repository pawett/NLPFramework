For his part , Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor .
People have predicted his demise so many times , and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions .
Time and again , he endures .
He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents .
Fidel Castro invited John Paul to come for a reason .
This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally .
The entire world will see images of the Pope in Cuba .
They 'll see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro .
It will give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation , something the US has , of course , tried to persuade the world that it is not .
For nearly forty years , the United States has said categorically it would not tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard .
It is the US economic and political embargo which has kept Cuba in a box .
The main positive for Castro to invite the Pope is international , to be able to say to the rest of the world , this government is not as closed , as intolerant , uh as totalitarian as some make it out to be .
One of the scenarios widely advanced before the visit is that through the Pope , Cuba , still led by Castro , can begin a more productive relationship with the world .
That will , in turn , bring pressure on Washington to change .
Those observers looking for a battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will , in all likelihood , be disappointed .
Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian .
He says he and the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man .
The question is who will Cubans believe ?
The main negative is the risk that the Pope 's visit will persuade a great many more Cubans to break loose of the Cuban government .
If so , then the Pope 's visit would really open up a new chapter in the government 's relations with its own society .
For the Cuban government , that is the risk .
At the end of the broadcast this evening , one more trip around Havana to see what it 's been like since the last time .
And in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news .
JERUSALEM ( AP ) _ Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon , where a costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers ' lives .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel 's northern frontier could be secured .
` ` If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon , we will be happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425 , ' ' Netanyahu told his ministers .
That 1978 resolution calls for Israel 's unconditional withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon , and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border .
On Friday , Netanyahu said he had ` ` no qualms ' ' about implementing the U.N. resolution , as long as Israel had ` ` the necessary security safeguards . ' ' Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu 's remarks marked a substantive change in Israel 's position .
` ` We will defend our north from the international border , ' ' said Eitan , the science minister .
` ` No one wants to stay in Lebanon ; thus we think it better to withdraw . ' ' Uri Lubrani , Israel 's top official for Lebanon affairs , also suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in Lebanon .
` ` This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk today _ full stop _ about security , ' ' Lubrani told Israel 's Channel One .
` ` We have gotten off the issue of peace , off the issue of normalization . ' ' As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted , the Israeli government has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for Israel 's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon .
Since 1985 _ when the Israelis created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas .
Last week , Hezbollah fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six others .
The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year .
In addition , 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed last February .
The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu 's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries .
The newspaper , quoting ` ` secret reports , ' ' said Syria had indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington , Walid Mualem , in a lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore .
Two top aides to Netanyahu , political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh , left for Europe on Sunday , apparently to investigate the Syrian issue , the newspaper said .
Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years .
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago , saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked .
Live from Atalanta , good evening Lynne Russell , CNN headline news .
New evidence is suggesting that a series of bombings in Atalanta and last month 's explosion at an Alabama women 's clinic might be related .
Pierre Thomas has the latest .
Atlanta nineteen ninety-six .
A bomb blast shocks the Olympic games .
One person is killed .
January nineteen ninety-seven .
Atlanta again .
This time a bomb at an abortion clinic .
More people are hurt .
And just last month , an off duty policeman is killed when a bomb explodes at another abortion clinic .
Location , Birmingham , Alabama .
This man , Eric Rudolph has already been charged in the Birmingham bombing .
Now officials are investigating whether , Rudolph , who remains at large , is linked to all three attacks .
The reason , authorities have discovered tantalizing new evidence .
Steel plates recovered at the Olympic park bombing appear to match those found at the abortion clinic bombing in Atlanta .
Those plates may have come from a machine shop in north Carolina , where a friend of Rudolph worked .
And nails found in the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing are identical to those discovered at Rudolph 's storage shed in north Carolina .
A senior law enforcement source tells CNN , there is a lot of circumstantial evidence and it would be extraordinary to have all these bits and pieces and there not be a connection .
And law enforcement sources say they ca n 't ignore letters penned under the name army of god .
Army of god is a secret organization that hates abortion providers , homosexuals and the US government .
Army of god letters claim responsibility for the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing , a nineteen ninety-seven attack on a gay lounge and the Birmingham assault .
An intense manhunt conducted by the FBI and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms continues for Rudolph in the wilderness of western north Carolina .
And this week , FBI director Louie Freeh assigned more agents to the search .
Freeh also ordered the investigation consolidate information under the Atlanta task force , another indication officials suspect a link between all the bombings .
Privately , authorities say Rudolph has become a focus of their investigation .
Publicly , they are unwilling to make any sweeping assertion .
The reason , they remember Richard Jewell .

NEWARK , N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began delving Thursday into the slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area , as law-enforcement officials acknowledged that they needed to work harder to solve the cases of murdered women .
The police and prosecutors said they had identified different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to find any pattern linking the killings or the victims , several of whom were believed to be prostitutes .
State , county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases .
Citing an example , Sgt .
Derek Glenn , a spokesman for the Newark Police Department , said that of nine women who had been killed last year , suspects had been arrested in only four cases .
But over all , arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases , he said .
Eight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department , Glenn said .
Of the eight victims , three were stabbed , two were strangled , two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated , he said , and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related .
But with the task-force investigation just getting under way , officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions , leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases .
There have been no arrests in any of the slayings .
` ` I have n 't seen a pattern yet , ' ' said Patricia Hurt , the Essex County prosecutor , who created the task force on Tuesday .
` ` The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous , ' ' she said .
Tomorrow the board of supervisors of Loudon county , Virginia , will vote on whether a school now located in Mount Vernon can relocate to their county .
In some respects , that 's typical county business , but tomorrow 's vote has international implications .
The board will decide whether the Islamic Saudi Academy , funded by the government of Saudi Arabia , can move to Ashburn village , Virginia .
But local residents have not exactly laid out the red carpet for their would be neighbors .
The World 's Nancy Marshalll has our story .
Inside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon , Virginia , many of the girls wear head scarves and some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms .
The instruction is in English for most classes , in Arabic for language and religious studies .
The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and good students .
They 're learning a civics lesson from the residents of Loudon county .
The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but would take thirty-five hundred if it had the room .
The academy bought a hundred acres in Loudon county , Virginia , and asked for permission to build a fifty million dollar campus .
In the nearby suburban housing tracts , someone dropped off leaflets warning the school could bring thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and terrorists .
Some residents of the mostly white , mostly middle class area became alarmed .
James Zogby of the Arab American Institute says it 's a familiar story .
There is , a- at a very deep level in our culture , um I think , a sense of , of ignorance about Islam , a fear about who Muslims are and what they 're doing .
Many local residents denounced the bigotry , but opposition to the school then shifted .
Now critics of the academy are targeting its owner , the Saudi government .
Pastor James Allmen of the fellowship church and school in Ashburn has led the anti-Saudi campaign .
James Allmen says he has no problem with a privately funded academy , but he has a big problem with a Saudi funded school .
The Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and is known to be one of the worst offending countries when it comes to religious persecution .
That 's correct .
And that is a condition of the application , then .
That is a condition of- At a public hearing on the Islamic Saudi Academy 's application , the split in county opinion was obvious , supporters of the academy , including Ann Robinson , said the Saudis were just providing a service and it was unfair to penalize children .
We do not further the purpose of human rights in the world by violating the human rights under our own constitution .
But opponents said the school might be a target for terrorist attacks , complained about its tax exempt status , and wondered why the Saudis are not compelled to allow Christians to worship in their country .
Virginia Welch delivered this message to the county board of supervisors .
I urge you to do the right thing and send a message to the Saudis that the citizens of Loudon county embrace religious and human freedom .
Loudon county officials say they 'll rule on the application based only on land use issues and ignore all the other objections .
What 's really behind those objections , some say , is Loudon county 's collision with a new reality in America that the country is changing religiously as surely as it is racially and ethnically .
According to the Arab American institute , Islam will one day be the second largest religion in the country .
For an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as they integrate into American life , one need look no farther than Loudon county , Virginia .
For The World , I 'm Nancy Marshalll .
Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A . , through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit , began its $37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V. , a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands .
The offer , advertised in today 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , is scheduled to expire at the the end of November .
Montedison currently owns about 72% of Erbamont 's common shares outstanding .
The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies .
ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars ( US$148.9 million to $153.3 million ) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares .
Perpetual preferred shares aren 't retractable by the holders , the company said .
Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares , but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place .
A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate has n 't yet been fixed , but will probably be set at around 8% .
He declined to discuss other terms of the issue .
Nashua Corp. , rumored a potential takeover target for six months , said that a Dutch company has sought U.S. approval to buy up to 25% of Nashua 's shares .
Nashua immediately responded by strengthening a poison-pill plan and saying it will buy back up to one million of its shares , or 10.4% of the 9.6 million outstanding .
Nashua , whose major business is selling copiers , facsimile machines and related supplies , said Reiss amp Co. B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $15 million of Nashua 's stock but less than 25% .
Previously , an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed a stake of less than 5% in Nashua , according to Daniel M. Junius , Nashua 's treasurer .
Nashua 's stock has fluctuated sharply on takeover speculation , rising to a high for the year of $42.875 a share in June from $29.75 in March .
But the company has had weak results so far this year , with earnings declining 43% to $13.7 million , or $1.43 a share , on a 4% decline in revenue to $713.5 million through the first nine months of the year .
Its stock has slumped recently , closing unchanged Friday at $29 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange ; at that price , the company has a market value of about $278.4 million .
Nashua announced the Reiss request after the market closed .
Mr. Junius said Nashua 's " intention is to remain an independent public company . "
The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price .
In addition , the company 's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares .
Under a program approved by the company in 1987 that did n 't specify a share amount , Nashua had purchased 481,000 shares through Sept. 29 .
Alex Henderson , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities , said that while Nashua 's performance this year has been " atrocious , " the company nonetheless is attractive as a " classic breakup candidate because there 's no similarity between its { four } businesses . "
He estimated the breakup value at $55 a share .
In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in Europe and copier supplies in the U.S. , Nashua has three other major businesses : labels and tapes , data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing .
Intel Corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts , but the " bugs " are n 't expected to hurt Intel and most computer makers .
Computer experts familiar with the flaws , found in Intel 's 80486 chip , say the defects do n 't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their " brains " appear on the market sometime next year .
Intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip 's " floating-point unit " , a set of circuits that do certain calculations .
On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations .
But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n 't affect them .
" Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , " said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems development .
Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year .
" These bugs do n 't affect our schedule at all , " he said .
Likewise , AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs wo n 't delay their development of 486-based machines .
" We have n 't modified our schedules in any way , " said a Sun spokesman .
To switch to another vendor 's chips , " would not definitely be an option , " he said .
Nonetheless , concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel 's stock to $32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading , on volume of 3,609,800 shares , and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq 's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday .
Yesterday , Compaq plunged further , closing at $100 a share , off $8.625 a share , on volume of 2,633,700 shares .
Most of Compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations .
Intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week .
" We should not be seeing any more , " said Bill Rash , Intel 's director for the 486 chip .
What 's more , the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations , he said , and then very seldom .
" These errata do not affect business programs , " he said .
The bugs will cause problems in " specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications " such as word-processing and spreadsheets , said Michael Slater , editor of the Microprocessor Report , an industry newsletter .
Sun , Hewlett-Packard and others say Intel isn 't wholly to blame for the snafu .
The real culprits , they said , are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products .
" The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability , " said Hewlett-Packard 's Mr. Archuleta .
" You can do that but you 're taking a risk .
Those companies are paying the price for taking the risk . "
In late September , IBM began shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine .
An IBM spokeswoman said the company told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product .
IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the spokeswoman said , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays .
" We do n 't look at this as a major problem for us , " she said .
Compaq , which said it discovered the bugs , still plans to announce new 486 products on Nov. 6 . Because of the glitch , however , the company said it does n 't know when its machine will be commercially available .
That 's a break from Compaq tradition , because the company does n 't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers .
The problem is being ballyhooed , experts say , because the 486 is Intel 's future flagship .
Intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines .
" Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon , the 486 is an extremely high-profile product , " said Mr. Slater , the newsletter editor .
Intel 's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel 's microprocessors , a super-fast , super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years .
Unveiled last April , the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon , more than four times as many as on Intel 's earlier model , 80386 .
Intel clocks the chip 's speed at 15 million instructions per second , or MIPs .
That 's four times as fast as the 386 .
Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers , which connect groups of computers together , and in computer-aided design .
But while the chip 's speed in processing power is dazzling , it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance .
The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer .
( A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer , 32-bit chips . )
Since then , Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips , all of which can run software written for previous models .
That 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs .
Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines , which are expected to reach the market early next year .
Of the big computer makers , only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead .
" The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry , " said Hewlett-Packard 's Mr. Archuleta .
" It 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years .
This bug is not going to have any affect on that at all . "

Norwood Partners Limited Partnership of Boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of Phoenix Technologies Ltd. 's common shares .
Norwood , Mass.-based Phoenix , a once-high-flying maker of software for personal computers , has had substantial losses in the past two quarters .
Its stock , which was as high as $18.75 a share , has been trading under $4 a share recently .
Yesterday it closed at $4.375 a share , up $1.125 , in national over-the-counter trading .
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Norwood said it 's part of a group that holds 525,546 Phoenix Technologies common shares , or a 5.3% stake .
Norwood has made " no detailed plans , " but it has engaged in talks with other shareholders , the filing said .
Phoenix declined to comment .
Norwood is controlled by Daniel L. Barnett and Paul A. Reese , both officers of Boston-based Oasis Capital Management Inc. , a small Boston money management firm .
Also involved in the group is Robert F. Angelo , formerly Phoenix 's senior vice president , field operations , who left Phoenix at the beginning of October .
Mr. Angelo was described in the filing as a consultant to Oasis .
Hudson 's Bay Co. announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected to raise about 396 million Canadian dollars ( US$337 million ) net of expenses .
Proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem C$264 million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt , the company said .
Canada 's largest department store operator said the rights offering will entitle holders of its ordinary shares , except residents in the U.S. and Britain , to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$31.25 a share .
The record date is Nov. 9 . The company has about 31 million ordinary shares outstanding .
On the Toronto Stock Exchange , Hudson 's Bay shares closed at C$35 , up 12.5 cents .
Hudson 's Bay said that Woodbridge Co. , which currently holds about 77% of the ordinary shares , will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that are n 't otherwise taken up .
Woodbridge is a holding company owned by Toronto 's Thomson family .
Hudson 's Bay said it will redeem 9.5 million Series H preferred shares on Oct. 31 at a price of C$27.75 each .
The move was approved at a special shareholders ' meeting yesterday .
Gary Lukassen , chief financial officer , said redemption of the preferred shares , originally issued at C$25 each , will eliminate dividend payments of C$17.9 million annually .
